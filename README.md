Hey guys,

So I started the project and basically all I've done so far is write the Customer, Transaction, Order, Payment, RepairBrand, and Date classes; I have not started the IO. So far there is only one glaring error which is that I wasn't able to parse a Transaction into an Order or Payment so if you could fix that that'd be nice. I also had a problem with accessing the ID from a given customer, it has something to do with ID being static I think.
